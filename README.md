Summary:

This project aims to predict house prices using a Linear Regression model.
The model was trained on data containing features such as:
Area (size of the house)
Bedrooms (number of rooms)
Age (how old the house is)
Location code (represents the neighborhood)
After training on 800 samples and testing on 200 samples, the model achieved a 97.5% accuracy with an average error of $17,170.
The results show that larger area, more bedrooms, and better location increase the house price, while older houses tend to have lower prices.
